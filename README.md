# Vim User Menu

Sometimes it doesn't fit right to add another function or command for yet
another code snippet spotted on GitHub or a Wiki. Drawbacks of such approach
include:

1. It's easy to forget about the snippets saved in such a way.
2. … or to forget the way that they should be used.
3. A sense of disorder might gradually arise when a larger number of such
   snippets will be stored and forgotten…

## Proposed alternative → a pop-up User Menu

An alternate approach is being proposed and implemented with this Vim plugin
— to gather the snippets as *entries in a pop-up user menu*. Benefits of such
approach:

1. The snippets aren't lost from the sight of the user, hence they cannot be
   forgotten.
2. There's no sense of disorder gradually arising, as there's no dark-area of
   vimrc that's growing.
3. It might be cool to for a difference *select* something in Vim, rather than
   to invoke a keystroke-command.
